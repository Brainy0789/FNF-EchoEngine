# Brainy Psych

Brainy's new psych fork 👀

tbh idk what i'll do with this engine besides adding [Wren](https://wren.io/) support. 

oh yeah softcoded state and substate support, softcoding some hardcoded things, etc.

Based on 0.7.3

This fork is mainly for personal use but i'll still release builds every so often so yeah 👍
